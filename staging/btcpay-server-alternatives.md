BTCPay Server is widely regarded as the gold standard for self-sovereign Bitcoin payments. It is free, open-source, noncustodial, and extraordinarily capable. It is also, for a lot of people, too much.

If you have landed here, you probably already know that. Maybe you tried to set it up and hit a wall at the Docker deployment. Maybe you got it running and realized you were now responsible for a Bitcoin full node, SSL certificates, and Lightning channel liquidity, all on top of whatever your actual business is. Maybe you just looked at the requirements and thought, "I invoice three clients a month. This is not for me."

You are not wrong. BTCPay was built to serve everyone from a solo freelancer to Namecheap. That range means the floor is higher than most small operators need it to be.

So what else is out there?

## What BTCPay does well and where it can get difficult

Before looking at alternatives, it is worth being specific about what you are trading away and what you are trying to escape. "BTCPay is too complicated" is the most common complaint, but that undersells the problem.

### The real pain points

**Setup is not plug-and-play.** BTCPay's Docker deployment takes over the entire machine so you can't really drop it into any existing Docker Compose stack alongside other services. One user on the BTCPay community forums offered $100 for someone to teach them how to install it. A milkweed seed merchant took three years from first attempt to getting it working. BTCPay's own docs acknowledge that "some technical understanding is required for initial setup."

**Infrastructure has real costs.** A full Bitcoin node needs 600GB+ of storage (pruned: ~60GB minimum), 2 CPUs, and 4GB RAM. VPS hosting runs $8–65/month depending on setup, and the initial blockchain sync takes one to five days on a VPS. A BTCPay maintainer has said he "wouldn't recommend a Raspberry Pi setup for eCommerce."

**Lightning is a second job.** BTCPay supports Lightning, but running your own Lightning node means managing channels, inbound liquidity, and routing all in perpetuity. A technically capable user in Guatemala spent a month trying to get Lightning working and still could not reliably receive payments. BTCPay's own FAQ calls inbound liquidity "one of the biggest UX struggles" with Lightning.

**Maintenance never stops.** Updates can break things. Plugin conflicts crash BTCPay at startup in loops. SSL certificates, LND authentication, and channel management are ongoing. The milkweed merchant again: "Without conversion to sales the BTC server node fees and lightning channel fees will drain my funds in a couple years."

### Features and qualities to keep

None of these are BTCPay exclusives. The right alternative keeps the ones that matter to you, while the wrong one quietly drops them.

- **Noncustodial architecture.** Some alternatives hold your Bitcoin for you. Sovereignty is not a given.
- **No transaction fees.** BTCPay charges nothing. Many alternatives charge around 1%. A few are also free.
- **Lightning support.** Some alternatives have it; some do not. Depends on your use case.
- **Integration depth.** BTCPay has 20+ e-commerce plugins and a full API. If you need Shopify or WooCommerce, check compatibility.
- **Scale.** BTCPay handles enterprise volume. Most small operators do not need this, but it is worth understanding.

If all of these matter and you have the technical capacity to run BTCPay, it is still the right answer. The rest of this article is for people who need something that works without becoming a sysadmin.

## Tradeoffs: what the differences mean for you

### Custody: who holds your money?

This is the single most important axis and the one many people skip.

**Noncustodial** means payments go directly to your wallet. No third party holds your Bitcoin; not a processor, not the tool, and not the company behind the tool. If the company disappears tomorrow, you still have your money. BTCPay, Blockonomics, Zaprite, Swiss Bitcoin Pay, Coinsnap, and CryptoZing work this way.

**Custodial** means the service receives payments on your behalf and then forwards them or holds them until you withdraw. OpenNode, Strike, CoinGate, BitPay, and Speed work this way. This is simpler, but it means trusting a company with your money and usually requires KYC.

### Complexity: how much do you want to manage?

The spectrum runs from "sign up, connect a wallet, and go" to "provision a VPS, deploy Docker, sync a full node, open Lightning channels, and maintain it all forever."

Many hosted alternatives land on the simpler end. The question is what you give up for that simplicity. It's usually some combination of control, privacy, and cost.

### Lightning vs on-chain only

Not every tool supports Lightning, and "supports Lightning" means very different things across tools.

Some tools let you bring your own Lightning node resulting in maximum sovereignty and maximum complexity. Others handle Lightning for you but take custody of those funds temporarily. And several tools: Blockonomics, Coinbase Commerce, NOWPayments, and CryptoZing, are on-chain only.

If your clients pay in amounts where on-chain fees are negligible relative to the invoice, Lightning may not matter. If you are processing high volumes of small payments, it can matter a lot.

### Cost: free is not always free

BTCPay is genuinely free — no subscription, no transaction fee. But you pay for infrastructure and your own time maintaining it.

Many alternatives flip that equation: they charge a fee (typically 1% or a monthly subscription) but eliminate the infrastructure burden. The question is whether the fee costs less than running BTCPay yourself. For low-volume merchants, it almost always does.

## The alternatives

### Custodial

These tools hold your Bitcoin temporarily or until you withdraw. Simpler setup, but you are trusting a third party company.

**13. BitPay**: bitpay.com
The oldest and largest Bitcoin payment processor. Founded 2011. 130,000+ merchants. 150+ fiat currencies. Also the most expensive: 2% + $0.25 per transaction at low volumes. Full invoice processing with a separate noncustodial wallet app. BitPay is what you use when your CFO needs a name they recognize. For a freelancer, the fees do not make sense.

**12. NOWPayments**: nowpayments.io
With 350+ supported cryptocurrencies, NOWPayments has the broadest crypto support in this list. Default noncustodial (forwarded to your wallet), optional custodial add-on. 0.5% base fee. On-chain only for BTC, so no Lightning. If you need to accept Bitcoin alongside dozens of altcoins, this is the tool.

**11. CoinGate**: coingate.com
1% flat fee. 70+ cryptocurrencies. EU-regulated and MiCA-licensed, supervised by the Bank of Lithuania. Order management, refunds, permissions, export. Lightning enabled by default. The strongest regulatory posture of any tool in this list, which matters if your business needs compliance documentation.

**10. Strike**: strike.me/en/business
Primarily a payment rail and API, not a standalone invoicing tool. Lightning-first. ~1% spread on currency conversion. USD balances are FDIC-insured; BTC is not. Shopify and NCR partnerships. Aimed at businesses that want Lightning payments integrated into existing infrastructure.

**9. Speed**: tryspeed.com
1% per payment, no other fees. Lightning-first with same-day ACH for USD conversion. Invoices, payment links, QR codes, subscription billing. Also supports USDC and USDT. MSB-licensed. Straightforward and low-cost.

**8. OpenNode**: opennode.com
1% per transaction, no monthly fee. Dashboard for creating and emailing invoices. Lightning and on-chain. KYC required. Optional fiat conversion. Well-funded ($24.7M raised). Clean API if you ever need to build on it.

### Noncustodial

These tools never hold your Bitcoin. Payments go to your wallet.

**7. Breez**: breez.technology
A self-custodial mobile wallet with a built-in POS. Not a full invoicing platform; it turns your phone into a Lightning cash register. 0.4–0.75% one-time channel opening fee, then just routing fees. Lightning only, no on-chain at the POS level. Built for in-person retail where you want self-custody and do not need traditional invoicing.

**6. Flash**: paywithflash.com
Zero fees, noncustodial, Lightning-native. Focused on digital content and SaaS payments for paywalls, subscriptions, payment links, and the like. Early-stage (500-user early access as of 2026). The 0% fee model raises obvious sustainability questions, but for the right use case it is worth watching.

**5. Swiss Bitcoin Pay**: swiss-bitcoin-pay.ch
Noncustodial with a strong physical retail focus. Lightning payments are converted to on-chain BTC and forwarded to your wallet every 24 hours. 0–1% for BTC, 1.5% if you want fiat payouts. Mobile app with basic invoicing and auto-generated tax reports. Swiss company, widely used in Lugano. Geared toward brick-and-mortar or POS scenarios rather than remote invoicing.

**4. Coinsnap**: coinsnap.io
Coinsnap has the lowest barrier to entry in this group; that's if you already have a Lightning address. Sign up with just an email and a Lightning address. 1% fee. 40+ e-commerce plugins. It's not a standalone invoicing platform, it's a payment gateway for online stores. If you need to add a "Pay with Bitcoin" button to WooCommerce and do not want to touch a server, this is it.

**3. Blockonomics**: blockonomics.co
Uses the same xpub model as BTCPay. Hosted, so no server to manage. 1% fee (first 20 transactions free). On-chain only so no Lightning. Notable for encrypted invoices: Blockonomics itself cannot see your invoice contents. 20+ e-commerce plugins. A solid, quiet workhorse if you want noncustodial without the infrastructure.

**2. Zaprite**: zaprite.com
The closest thing to a full invoicing platform in this list. USD-denominated invoices with line items, tax percentages, and recurring billing. Supports fiat and Bitcoin on the same checkout so your client chooses how to pay. Connects to your own wallets (hardware wallet support, multi-sig) and Lightning nodes. $25/month flat, no transaction fee on invoicing. QuickBooks integration. The main drawbacks: no mobile app, sparse documentation, and that $25/month is a real barrier for someone invoicing a few hundred dollars a month.

**1. CryptoZing**: cryptozing.app
This is us! We're partial but we'll try to be objective. Still, take this with the appropriate grain of salt.

CryptoZing is a noncustodial Bitcoin invoicing tool built for freelancers and small businesses. USD-denominated invoices with BTC computed at current rates. Watch-only architecture using your xpub so we never hold or have access to your private keys. Automatic on-chain payment detection. Self-hostable (Laravel/Docker) or hosted if you don't want to worry about servers or installs — just sign up, complete the quick walk-through and send an invoice.

What we do not have (or have yet): Lightning support (we're on-chain only), CSV/JSON export, recurring invoices, or a QuickBooks integration. Client management is minimal. Reporting is dashboard-only for now. We are pre-release, with an open beta projected around late 2026 and a first public release around mid-to-late 2027. No fees during beta. Long-term pricing hasn't been decided; free is still on the table, and if not, the intent is to keep it very low.

| Noncustodial tool | Lightning | Fee | Invoicing | Client Mgmt | Reporting | Self-host |
|-------------------|-----------|-----|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| BTCPay Server | Yes | 0% | Full | No | Export + reporting | Yes |
| **CryptoZing** | **No** | **0% (beta)** | **Full** | **Basic** | **Dashboard only** | **Yes** |
| Zaprite | Yes | $25/mo | Full | Basic | CSV + QuickBooks | No |
| Blockonomics | No | 1% | Yes | No | Unknown | No |
| Coinsnap | Yes | 1% | Basic (plugins) | No | Unknown | No |
| Swiss Bitcoin Pay | Yes | 0–1% | Basic | No | Auto tax reports | No |
| Flash | Yes | 0% | Basic | No | Unknown | No |
| Breez | Yes (only) | 0.4–0.75% setup | POS only | No | Export only | No |

## So which one?

**"I just want to invoice clients in Bitcoin without managing a server."**
Blockonomics or CryptoZing. Both are noncustodial, xpub-based, and hosted. Blockonomics is established with a 1% fee. CryptoZing is pre-release and free but earlier in its lifecycle.

**"I need fiat and Bitcoin on the same invoice."**
Zaprite. It is the only noncustodial tool here that does this well. $25/month.

**"I need Lightning."**
Zaprite if you want to bring your own node. Swiss Bitcoin Pay or Coinsnap if you want it handled for you. On the custodial side, OpenNode and Strike are Lightning-native.

**"I want to self-host but BTCPay is too much."**
CryptoZing is self-hostable via Docker without requiring a full Bitcoin node. BTCPay is the only other self-hostable option we're aware of.

**"I need a recognized company behind it."**
BitPay (oldest, most expensive), OpenNode (well-funded), or CoinGate (EU-regulated).

**"I want the simplest possible setup."**
Coinsnap if you have a Lightning address. Blockonomics if you have an xpub. Both take minutes.

## Closing

Every tool in this article is balancing the same tensions: sovereignty, simplicity, cost, and capability. None of them get all four right.

BTCPay gives you maximum sovereignty and asks you to earn it. Custodial tools give you maximum simplicity and ask you to trust someone.

There is no tool that gives you everything. If someone is selling you that, they are leaving something out.

What you can do is figure out which tradeoffs you can live with. For a lot of freelancers and small businesses, the answer turns out to be simpler than they expected.
